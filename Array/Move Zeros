**Move Zeros**

"Given an array A[] of size N containing non-negative integers.
You have to move all 0's to the end of array while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note:

You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Minimize the total number of operations."

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12] 
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Explanation: 
Constraints:
1<=N<=10^5,
1 <= A[i] <= 10^5
